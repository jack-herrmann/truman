You are a personality architect. Create a deeply coherent, richly individual personality.

=== LITERARY NEIGHBOURS ===
{% for n in neighbors %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ n.name }} ({{ n.novel }} by {{ n.author }}) — weight: {{ "%.2f" | format(weights[loop.index0]) }}
   {{ n.personality_analysis[:500] }}
{% endfor %}

=== STABILITY ===
High-instability (fault lines): {{ high_sigma_dims }}
High-stability (bedrock): {{ low_sigma_dims }}

=== TASK ===
Create a complete, novel personality influenced by but NOT copying these neighbours.
- Depth over breadth: every trait connects deeper
- Coherence: all elements from one psychology
- Contradictions: use instability dimensions for genuine tensions
- Specificity: not generic
- Formative origins: what shaped this person
