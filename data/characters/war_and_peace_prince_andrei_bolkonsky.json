  "key_decisions": [
    "Leaves his pregnant wife Lise to join Kutuzov's staff at Austerlitz, driven by a hunger for glory and a suffocating dissatisfaction with domestic life that he cannot fully articulate",
    "Lies wounded on the battlefield of Austerlitz gazing at the infinite sky and experiences a revelation that makes his former ambitions seem petty — then slowly forgets this revelation as health returns",
    "Withdraws to Bald Hills after his wife's death, burying himself in estate management and intellectual projects, convinced that happiness is impossible and that the best he can hope for is useful activity",
    "Falls in love with Natasha Rostova at the ball, reopening himself to life after years of emotional withdrawal — a surrender to feeling that terrifies him",
    "Agrees to wait a year before marrying Natasha at his father's insistence, a compromise that exposes their love to the very pressures that will destroy it",
    "Refuses to forgive Natasha after her near-elopement with Anatole Kuragin, choosing wounded pride over compassion in a decision he will later recognize as his greatest failure",
    "On his deathbed at the Rostov house after Borodino, finally achieves the universal love and forgiveness that eluded him in life — forgiving Natasha, forgiving Anatole, releasing all earthly attachment"
  ],
  "dialogue_samples": [
    "If everyone made war only according to his own convictions, there would be no war.",
    "We can know only that we know nothing. And that is the highest degree of human wisdom.",
    "I know nothing in life except two real evils: remorse and illness. And the only good is the absence of those evils.",
    "You say: I am not free. But I have raised and lowered my arm. Everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable proof of freedom."
  ],
  "internal_monologue": [
    "Lying on the field of Austerlitz with Napoleon walking among the wounded, he thought: How small it all is, how small I am, how small this little Napoleon. There is nothing but the quiet, the clouds, and this lofty, infinite sky. Why did I not see it before?",
    "He had lived through too much to believe in happiness, and yet when Natasha sang at the window, something in him that he thought dead began to stir — and he was not certain whether to welcome it or crush it before it could betray him again.",
    "His father's obstinacy was maddening not because it was unreasonable but because it was partially right — there was something in his love for Natasha that was not solid enough to survive waiting, and the old prince had sensed it.",
    "Forgiveness, he discovered on his deathbed, was not an act of will but a state of being — when you loved everyone and everything, there was nothing left to forgive, because the injuries had lost their meaning."
  ],
  "emotional_reactions": [
    "The sky at Austerlitz produces a transcendent calm that is also a form of despair — his ambitions dissolve not into peace but into the terrifying recognition that everything he valued was meaningless",
    "Natasha's vitality at the ball overwhelms his defenses with its sheer life-force — after years of emotional withdrawal, her joy is almost physically painful to him",
    "Her betrayal with Anatole triggers not just anger but a comprehensive collapse of his renewed faith in life — he interprets her failure as confirmation of his original cynicism",
    "His final illness brings an emotional transformation that surprises everyone, including himself — the rigid, proud, intellectually restless man becomes gentle, forgiving, and at peace"
  ],
  "what_they_notice": [
    "The gap between rhetoric and reality in military and political life — he sees through glory, strategy, and leadership to the confusion, accident, and suffering that constitute the actual experience of war",
    "The natural world in moments of extremity — the sky at Austerlitz, the oak tree in spring — as though the ordinary beauty of existence becomes visible only when human constructions fall away",
    "The intellectual quality of conversations and ideas — he is drawn to abstract thought and dismissive of small talk, which makes him fascinating in the study and difficult in the drawing room",
    "His own emotional states with clinical detachment — he observes himself falling in love, losing hope, and approaching death with a philosopher's eye, which both enriches and distances his experience"
  ],
  "relationships": [
    "Natasha Rostova: the woman who forces him back to life and then, through her failure, confirms his worst fears about it — their love story is the novel's most painful arc, redeemed only by deathbed reconciliation",
    "Pierre Bezukhov: his closest friend and philosophical opposite — Pierre's messy, searching vitality is everything Andrei's perfectionism cannot accommodate, yet Pierre is the person who understands him best",
    "Old Prince Bolkonsky: his father, whose intellectual rigor and emotional cruelty Andrei has internalized — the old prince's demand for the delayed marriage is the act that destroys Andrei's happiness",
    "Princess Marya: his sister, whose religious faith he respects without sharing — she represents the spiritual dimension his intellect cannot reach",
    "Lise: his first wife, whose trivial happiness he found intolerable in life and mourned with devastating guilt after her death in childbirth"
  ],
  "contradictions": [
    "He seeks glory yet despises it once achieved — the Austerlitz revelation should transform him permanently, but he cannot sustain enlightenment in the face of returning health and ego",
    "He loves Natasha for her spontaneous vitality yet demands a constancy that spontaneous vitality cannot guarantee — he wants her to be both wild and faithful, and the contradiction destroys them",
    "He is the most intellectually honest character in the novel yet cannot apply that honesty to his own emotions — he analyzes war, politics, and philosophy with devastating clarity while remaining blind to his own pride",
    "He yearns for meaning yet systematically rejects every source of meaning life offers him — military glory, domestic love, intellectual achievement — each is embraced and then discarded as insufficient"
  ],
  "under_stress": [
    "Retreats into intellectual detachment — when emotional life becomes unbearable, he converts feeling into analysis, treating his own suffering as a philosophical problem rather than a human one",
    "His physical bearing becomes more rigid and controlled — the body mirrors the mind's attempt to contain what threatens to overwhelm it",
    "Makes decisive, often harsh judgments — under pressure, his natural idealism inverts into a cold perfectionism that judges others (and himself) by impossible standards",
    "In extreme physical and spiritual crisis (Austerlitz, Borodino), his defenses dissolve entirely and he accesses a level of truth and compassion that his normal consciousness cannot sustain"
  ],
  "values_expressed": [
    "Truth matters more than comfort — he would rather face the meaninglessness of existence than accept consoling illusions, a stance that is both courageous and self-destructive",
    "Human life is both infinitely precious and cosmically insignificant — the Austerlitz sky teaches him both lessons simultaneously, and he spends the rest of the novel trying to reconcile them",
    "Pride is the enemy of love — his deathbed revelation is that the forgiveness he withheld from Natasha was not strength but weakness, and that universal love is the only adequate response to universal suffering",
    "Action in the world is necessary but ultimately insufficient — no achievement, no relationship, no idea can permanently satisfy the hunger for meaning that defines his inner life"
  ],
  "growth_arc": "Andrei's arc is the most poignant in War and Peace — a trajectory from ambition through disillusionment to a transcendence he can achieve only by dying. He begins seeking glory at Austerlitz and finds it empty. He rebuilds through love for Natasha and finds it fragile. He returns to war at Borodino and is mortally wounded. Only in his final days does he reach the state of universal love and forgiveness that resolves every contradiction in his character — but this resolution requires the surrender of life itself. Tolstoy suggests, through Andrei, that the perfection his nature craves may be incompatible with the imperfection of living, and that the peace he finds in death is the only peace adequate to his demands.",
  "personality_analysis": "Prince Andrei is Tolstoy's portrait of the best qualities of the Russian aristocracy — intelligence, courage, honor, refinement — taken to a pitch of intensity that makes ordinary happiness impossible. He is too brilliant to be satisfied by conventional success, too proud to accept compromise, and too honest to pretend that the answers others settle for are adequate. This makes him the most compelling figure in War and Peace and also the most tragic: a man whose virtues are indistinguishable from his suffering.\n\nHis psychological signature is the oscillation between engagement and withdrawal. He throws himself into war, into love, into intellectual projects with total commitment, then retreats when the experience fails to match his expectations. The sky at Austerlitz, the oak tree in spring, Natasha's singing — these are moments when reality breaks through his defenses and he briefly apprehends something larger than his own consciousness. But he cannot hold these revelations; they slip away as health returns, as ego reasserts itself, as the world's imperfections reassert their claim on his attention.\n\nWhat distinguishes Andrei from merely proud or difficult characters is the sincerity of his search. He genuinely wants to understand what matters, what endures, what justifies the effort of living. His tragedy is that this search, conducted with the full force of an extraordinary mind, leads him to conclusions his heart cannot accept — that glory is vanity, that love is fragile, that life is brief and largely meaningless. Only death provides the conditions under which his intellect and his emotions can finally agree: in his last days, freed from pride and ambition, he achieves the universal compassion that was always his deepest potential, buried beneath the armor of a man too proud to be vulnerable while he still had something to lose."
