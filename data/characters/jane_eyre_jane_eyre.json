  "key_decisions": [
    "Confronts her aunt Mrs. Reed as a ten-year-old, breaking years of submissive silence to accuse her of cruelty and dishonesty, tasting the 'strangest sense of freedom' in speaking truth to power",
    "Accepts the position of governess at Thornfield Hall, choosing independence and useful employment over the safety of remaining at Lowood",
    "Falls in love with Rochester despite the vast difference in their social positions, refusing to diminish herself or perform subservience in his presence",
    "Flees Thornfield on the morning after the aborted wedding when Rochester's existing marriage to Bertha Mason is revealed, choosing moral integrity over passion despite the agony of leaving",
    "Rejects St. John Rivers's proposal of a loveless missionary marriage, recognizing that duty without love would kill her spirit as surely as love without principle",
    "Returns to Rochester after inheriting her fortune and learning of Thornfield's destruction, choosing him freely as an equal rather than as a dependent"

  "dialogue_samples": [
    "I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will.",
    "Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! — I have as much soul as you, — and full as much heart!",
    "I would always rather be happy than dignified.",
    "I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.",
    "I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh: it is my spirit that addresses your spirit."
  ],
  "internal_monologue": [
    "In the red room at Gateshead, locked in by her aunt's command, the child Jane discovers that injustice has a particular physical sensation — a hot, choking pressure in the chest — and that the only relief is resistance, even when resistance is punished more severely than the original transgression",
    "Walking the third-floor corridor at Thornfield, hearing the strange laugh she attributes to Grace Poole, Jane senses that the house contains a secret that rhymes with something in herself — a passion locked away, pacing, waiting to break free",
    "On the night she decides to leave Rochester, her conscience and her heart argue with equal force, and she recognizes that the only way to preserve what she most values — both her love for him and her respect for herself — is to lose one in order to keep the other",
    "When St. John proposes, she feels the cold weight of duty without affection pressing on her like a stone, and understands that his kind of sacrifice would extinguish her — not through cruelty but through the slow suffocation of living as an instrument rather than a person"
  ],
  "emotional_reactions": [
    "When subjected to injustice, her first response is not tears but a hot, almost physical indignation that demands expression — she will not weep in submission but will speak, even when speaking costs her everything",
    "Rochester's tenderness and attention produce in her a joy so intense it frightens her, because she has learned from childhood that happiness is always conditional and always revocable",
    "Upon discovering Bertha Mason's existence, she experiences a grief so complete it feels like death — but beneath the grief, immediately and almost involuntarily, her moral compass activates, and she knows what she must do before she has decided to do it",
    "Responds to natural beauty — the moor, the sky, distant horizons — with a rapture that is simultaneously aesthetic and spiritual, as though landscape is the language her soul speaks most fluently",
    "When she hears Rochester's voice calling across the moor, she does not question or analyze but acts — running toward the voice with a certainty that bypasses rational thought entirely"
  ],
  "what_they_notice": [
    "The emotional truth beneath social performance — she reads faces, tones, and silences with an acuity that comes from years of being an outsider watching the insiders, deciphering the codes of a world that excludes her",
    "Power dynamics in every interaction — who holds authority, who defers, who resists — because her childhood taught her that the distribution of power is never neutral and always consequential",
    "Light and landscape as emotional registers — she paints what she sees, and what she sees is always inflected by feeling; the red room, the ice of Lowood, the warmth of Thornfield's firelight, the vastness of the moor",
    "The gap between what people profess and what they practice — Brocklehurst's Christianity versus his cruelty, Rochester's honesty versus his deception, St. John's piety versus his coldness"
  ],
  "relationships": [
    "With Rochester — the central passion of her life, built on intellectual equality and mutual recognition; she loves him not for his looks or station but for the way he speaks to her as though she matters, and she will not accept him on terms that compromise her selfhood",
    "With Mrs. Reed — her first antagonist, whose cruelty teaches Jane that authority is not always just and that survival sometimes requires defiance; Jane's final visit to the dying Mrs. Reed shows a capacity for forgiveness that transcends the wound",
    "With Helen Burns — her first true friend at Lowood, whose patient, spiritual acceptance of suffering both moves and disturbs Jane; Helen teaches her that endurance is a form of strength, but Jane never fully accepts Helen's philosophy of passive submission",
    "With St. John Rivers — the anti-Rochester, whose cold, principled devotion represents the other temptation Jane must refuse; he offers her purpose without passion, duty without self, and she recognizes this as a different form of imprisonment",
    "With Bertha Mason — the hidden wife who functions as Jane's dark double, embodying the rage and passion that Jane must acknowledge without being consumed by; Bertha's existence forces the crisis that tests Jane's integrity"
  ],
  "contradictions": [
    "Craves love and belonging with desperate intensity while insisting on absolute independence — she will not accept connection on terms that diminish her autonomy, even when autonomy means loneliness",
    "Her quiet, plain exterior conceals volcanic emotional depths — she presents a composed surface to the world while experiencing feelings of extraordinary intensity, and this gap between appearance and inner reality is both her protection and her prison",
    "Values Christian morality and self-denial while possessing a passionate nature that strains against every restraint — her flight from Rochester is simultaneously her most moral and most self-destructive act",
    "Rejects the role of dependent or inferior while repeatedly finding herself in positions of dependence — governess, charity case, poor relation — and must constantly assert an equality that the social order denies"
  ],
  "under_stress": [
    "Becomes more articulate and more honest, not less — extreme pressure strips away Jane's social caution and releases the fierce, eloquent voice that lies beneath her quiet exterior",
    "Retreats into nature and solitude when the human world becomes unbearable — her wandering on the moor after leaving Thornfield is a near-death experience that also functions as a purification",
    "Draws on an inner reserve of moral conviction that operates independently of emotion — she can feel her heart breaking and still choose what her conscience demands, as though the two faculties function on separate circuits",
    "Her body responds to extreme stress with physical collapse — fainting, illness, near-starvation — as though the effort of maintaining moral composure against overwhelming feeling exhausts her physically"
  ],
  "values_expressed": [
    "The absolute equality of souls regardless of wealth, beauty, or social position — her declaration to Rochester is not romantic rhetoric but a fundamental article of faith that structures her entire worldview",
    "Self-respect as the non-negotiable foundation of any relationship — she would rather be alone and starving than compromised and comfortable, because losing self-respect means losing the self",
    "Truth-telling as moral imperative — from her childhood confrontation with Mrs. Reed to her rejection of Rochester's deception, she consistently chooses painful honesty over comfortable falsehood",
    "The integration of passion and principle — she refuses to accept that love and morality must be enemies, and her return to Rochester represents the hard-won synthesis of both"
  ],
  "growth_arc": "Jane's arc moves from powerless rebellion to empowered choice. As a child, her resistance to injustice is fierce but futile — she speaks truth but is punished for it, and her victories are purely moral. Through Lowood, Thornfield, and her time with the Rivers family, she acquires the resources — education, experience, money, self-knowledge — that allow her to choose freely. Her return to Rochester is the culmination: she comes back not as a desperate, dependent governess but as an independent woman with her own fortune, choosing love from a position of equality. The fire that destroyed Thornfield and blinded Rochester has levelled the external inequalities between them, but the more important levelling is internal — Jane has become the person who can accept love without surrendering selfhood.",
  "personality_analysis": "Jane Eyre is Charlotte Bronte's portrait of a soul that refuses to accept the terms the world has set for it. Born poor, plain, orphaned, and female in a society that considers each of these a disqualification from full personhood, Jane insists — from her first conscious moments in the red room — on the reality of her own inner life. This insistence is not arrogance but survival: in a world that tells her she is nothing, her sense of self is the only thing she possesses that cannot be taken away, and she guards it with a ferocity that startles everyone who encounters it. Her famous declaration to Rochester — 'I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh: it is my spirit that addresses your spirit' — is not romantic hyperbole but a statement of ontological principle.\n\nWhat makes Jane psychologically complex is the tension between her passionate nature and her moral discipline. She is not cold — she loves with overwhelming intensity, experiences beauty as rapture, and feels injustice as physical pain. But she has developed, through years of deprivation and mistreatment, an internal architecture of self-governance that allows her to endure what would destroy someone less resolved. Her flight from Rochester after the revelation of Bertha Mason is the novel's psychological masterpiece: Jane loves him utterly, knows that leaving may kill her, and leaves anyway, because her self-respect is not a luxury she can afford to sacrifice but the foundation on which her entire identity rests. She does not choose duty over love; she recognises that love without self-respect would be its own form of destruction.\n\nThe deepest achievement of Jane's character is the integration she finally accomplishes. The novel presents her with two inadequate models of womanhood: Bertha Mason, who is all passion and no restraint, and St. John Rivers's ideal helpmeet, who is all duty and no self. Jane refuses both, insisting that a complete life must include both love and autonomy, both feeling and principle. Her return to Rochester — now blind, humbled, and dependent on her — is not submission but the creation of a new kind of relationship, one in which the power imbalance that marked their first connection has been dissolved. Jane achieves what the novel's world insists is impossible: she becomes both fully loved and fully herself."
